I recently had the honor to be a guest on the [Austin Real Estate Investing Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/arian-cabrera-alvarez-data-analyst-real-estate-investor/id1526289523?i=1000545207516). It was my first time doing something like that and have to admit, it was an amazing experience. The host of the podcast is Jordan Moorhead.  A realtor who also invests in Real Estate, both actively and passively mainly in the Austin, TX area. He is also a good friend.

As someone who is starting in the real estate investing world. And had to work his way up through the challenges of moving to the USA. And starting from scratch on a different culture and language. I’m very honored for the opportunity to share my experiences in the podcast.

### Topics we covered:

We had a great conversation about my Real Estate investment experience. Answered several questions that Jordan was curious to know about myself, including my favorite place to eat in Austin, Texas. Go check the podcast if you are curious!

Some topics we touched on, for instance:

* Whom I inherited my love for real estate.

* How even in a hot market, there is always an opportunity to find great deals.

* Why you should start investing right now and never give up.

Ultimately, I sincerely hope that my interview helps as inspiration for all those who are still debating on starting on this path. Understand that even in a hot market there are some chances for everyone. One just need to seriously look and focus on the future.

Lastly, I invite you to listen to the episode and to follow the [Austin Real Estate Investing Podcast](https://www.austinrealestateinvestingpodcast.com/) on your favorite streaming platform. You’ll find amazing guests, with lots of experience and knowledge. There are tons of great advice, and new ideas for your next project.

Remember as most investors say: 

“The best time to invest was yesterday, the second-best time is today, and the worst time is tomorrow”.
