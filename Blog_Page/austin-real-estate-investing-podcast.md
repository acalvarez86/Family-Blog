I recently had the honor to be a guest in the [Austin Real Estate Investing](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/austin-real-estate-investing/id1526289523) podcast. It was my first time doing something like that and have to admit, it was an amazing experience.  

The host of the podcast is Jordan Moorhead, who is a realtor that also invests in Real Estate, both actively and passively mainly in the Austin, TX area, and who is also a good friend. 
I’m very honored for the opportunity to share my experiences as someone who is starting in the real estate investing world and really hope that my story as an immigrant that had to work his way up through the challenges of moving to the USA and starting from scratch on a different culture and language, can serve as inspiration for all those who are still debating on starting in this path. 

### Topics we covered:
We had a great conversation about my Real Estate investment experience. Answered several questions that Jordan was curious to know about myself, including my favorite place to eat in Austin, Texas. Go check the podcast if you are curious. In general, we went over the following:

* Whom I inherited the love for real estate from.
* How even in a hot market, there is always an opportunity to find great deals.
* Why you should start investing right now and never give up.

I sincerely hope that my interview helps you find some motivation and understand that even in a hot market there are some chances for everyone that are seriously looking and focused on their future.

I now invite you to listen to the episode and to follow the podcast. You’ll find amazing guests, with lots of experience and knowledge, great advice, and tons of new ideas for  your next project.

Remember as most investors say: “the best time to invest was yesterday, the second best time is today, and the worst time is tomorrow.”
