Let's begin by clarifying this post is not meant to provide you all the steps to travel to Cancun, Mexico the cheapest possible. Nor to promote any specific luxury place. This guide is meant for you to use our experience to plan your trip the best possible.

We have known Cancun by pictures and stories from friends and family. Although we happened to pass by one time in our trip to the USA, it was definitely not vacationing. Mexico and its culture its amazing, and we loved it. "The Riviera Maya", the wonderful beaches, the local cuisine, you name it. 

It was our first trip to a different country for vacation. We picked it out of a whim. Everything came together in one of our regular Costco runs. Costco was advertising what we thought were good and not too expensive travel packages. The hardest decision was the hotel. We went back and forward picking from several options. Only one thing was certain, we looked for adults only hotel. The idea of kids yelling, crying or running around was out of the plate for this trip.

### Our Stay

The winner was the Marriott Cancun. It is located besides the JW Marriott. You can access all the amenities in both hotels, so we picked the Marriott because it was cheaper. Honestly speaking, we only visit the JW Marriott once just for curiosity as we didn't have time to enjoy the hotel at all. Trust me, you will spend most of your time doing excursions and trips and eating out while doing so. The few things we did at the hotel was: Eating when we didn't have a trip that took the whole day. Luckily we did not pay for the all-inclusive package, as most of our excursions had dinner included. Off course sleep, and relaxing in the jacuzzi before doing so. We also took a couples massage at it was my first time. This really help relax after all the different excursions.

As we mentioned, we picked what we thought was a good hotel. Based on price amenities, etc. Honestly after our experience, we should have gone for a cheaper one. Yep, as I mentioned we technically used the hotel to sleep, and as our hub for excursions. There were several times we got to hotel pass 9 pm. Therefore, paying extra for the amenities or luxury things it was just not worth it for us. If you get the all-inclusive package for the drinks (alcohol), I advise going to a local market and get your favorite. We did it and ended up gifting the bottles of wine to the service staff. Guess what? You are correct! We didn't have time to drink. We got to the hotel exhausted every time, we just took a shower and slept to be ready for the next adventure.

### Our Arrival

The Costco package included everything. The hotel, the flights, the transportation from the Airport to the hotel and the other way around. It does not include the excursions. For the trip we decided to take carry on only. Since it is an international airport, we weren't sure we wanted to wait for our baggage, and we wanted to get out faster. So we did. We passed customs quickly enough and head to find were our transportation will be. Let me tell you the instructions were good enough, but we still asked for directions. I bet most locals at the airport may know whatever language you speak, but luckily we know Spanish. Regardless of knowing the language we were approached by good amount of people selling stuff, or promoting services. Taxis, places to stay, excursions, timeshares, disco nights, restaurants. It is overwhelming. We aren't used to this, but we think we are good at ignoring all this noise without being rude. Regardless, the person we asked for directions told us to talk to this charming lady that was on a boot. Super nice and easy to talk to, she was selling timeshares. Quickly, she got the hint we were not interested, we just wanted to get out to the hotel as soon as possible. Therefore, she kindly explained to us were we should head to get our transportation. In addition, she mentioned that if we have some time to spare the next morning she will take us to this place we will get free breakfast on a newly constructed hotel. If we do this we will get half off all the excursions package. My wife quickly asked what was the catch, and she confirmed they will try to sell us the timeshare. We say yes to her, and move along. After we left her boot no one else approached us as they may have thought they got us. In part, they did. 

Since it was a shared ride (free), we had to wait a bit for all the people. But finally we made it to the hotel late afternoon. Had some time to check in, take a shower, and find somewhere to have dinner. The hotel had this great Polynesian style restaurant which performs some characteristics dances, and we enjoyed it. 

### The first day

The next day the salesperson who sold us the excursion package took us to the Garza Blanca Hotel. There we got access to their breakfast buffet which was really great. During the whole time another kind lady accompanied us, and we talked about life rather that the timeshare. The two hours that we needed to listen to all the selling stuff to get our discount passed fast. However, every time I thought we were leaving, another salesperson will come talk to us to try to sell us another package at a "great" discount. At the end we got our discounts and our excursion package after almost losing my patience. We left pass to lunchtime, but we needed to get some provisions to bring to the hotel. Taking this chance to try some local food at the local market. Again several people try to sell you stuff, but since we know the language it was not difficult to dodge those. 

Back to the hotel we spend the rest of the day, drinking our "provisions" by the pool, and tried a different restaurant this time. 

Before going to bed to rest for our first excursion we planned our itinerary. We were told that Playa Mujeres was the shortest excursion, it starts around 12:00PM and back by 7:00 PM, so we decided to put it in the middle to have more time to rest. Xcaret first, as we were told it was great, and Xixen Itza for last. Having an extra day before our last day, we decided to rest and enjoy the hotel. Therefore, we scheduled to have a massage that morning and enjoy the beach all afternoon. This was a great idea, as we did too much walking and several activities that takes a toll on your body.

### Xcaret

This trip started early in the morning we barely had time for a coffee. The bus was on time, and we head to the park. The trip takes about and hour or so and there could be line of buses arriving at the same time. Listen to the guide's instructions as it helps for a smooth adventure. There are several attractions that you have to pay for, apart from the excursion package. We paid for swimming with the Dolphins as Melba hadn't done it before. It is a spectacular experience. Unfortunately do to weather issues we couldn't swim with the whale sharks or walk with the Stingrays. Yeah, so sad, we would have paid for it if it were opened. The last attraction for the night is an amazing show with lots of great music scenery and acrobatics. We decided to get the dinner package, where they serve you several typical plates and drinks while watching the magical show about Mexico history.
