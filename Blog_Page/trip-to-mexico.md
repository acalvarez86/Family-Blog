Let’s start by clarifying that this post isn’t about finding the cheapest way to travel to Cancun or promoting any specific luxury resorts. Instead, we’re sharing our experience to help you plan your trip in the best possible way.
We had always seen Cancun in pictures and heard stories from friends and family. Although we passed by once during our trip to migrate to the USA, it wasn’t a vacation. When the opportunity arose, we decided to explore Mexico and its rich culture. The Riviera Maya, with its stunning beaches and local cuisine, was an irresistible choice.
It was our first trip abroad for a vacation, chosen almost on a whim. During one of our regular Costco runs, we spotted travel packages that seemed good and reasonably priced. The toughest part was selecting a hotel. After much deliberation, we decided on an adults-only hotel. The idea of kids yelling, crying, or running around was out of the plate for this trip.

### Our Stay

The winner was the Marriott Cancun, located next to the JW Marriott. You can use amenities from both hotels, but we opted for the Marriott because it was more affordable. In retrospect, we only visited the JW Marriott once out of curiosity. We spent most of our time on excursions, so the hotel was primarily a place to sleep and relax. Trust me, you will spend most of your time doing excursions and trips and eating out while doing so. Luckily we did not pay for the all-inclusive package, as most of our excursions had dinner included. We enjoyed the hotel’s amenities sparingly: dining when we didn’t have a full-day excursion, relaxing in the jacuzzi, and indulging in a couples massage. The latter was a first for us and proved to be a great way to unwind after our busy days.

Reflecting on our experience, we might have saved money with a cheaper hotel. We mainly used it as a base for our activities. We often returned to the hotel past 9 PM, so paying extra for luxury amenities didn’t feel worth it. If you get an all-inclusive package for the drinks, consider buying your favorite beverages at a local market. We did this and ended up gifting the wine to the hotel staff. Guess what? You are correct! We didn't have time to drink. We got to the hotel exhausted every time, we just took a shower and slept to be ready for the next adventure.

### Our Arrival
<img class="alignright wp-image-348" src="https://familyventurescafe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/hotel_beach_cancun-300x200.webp" alt="" width="400" height="267" />

The Costco package covered everything: hotel, flights, and airport transfers, but not the excursions. We decided to travel with carry-on luggage only to avoid delays at customs and speed up our exit. Upon arrival, the airport was bustling with people selling various services and products, which was overwhelming. I bet most locals at the airport may know whatever language you speak, but luckily, knowing Spanish helped us navigate through the chaos. The instructions were good enough, but we still asked for directions. We aren't used to this, but we think we are good at ignoring all this noise without being rude. Regardless, the person we asked for directions told us to talk to this charming lady who was on a boot. 

She was super nice and easy to talk to, she was selling timeshares. Quickly, she got the hint we were not interested, we just wanted to get out to the hotel as soon as possible. Therefore, she kindly explained to us where we should head to get our transportation. In addition, she mentioned that if we have some time to spare the next morning she will take us to this newly built hotel. We would get free breakfast and half off the excursion package if we do this. My wife quickly asked what the catch was, and she confirmed they would try to sell us the timeshare. We say yes to her, and move along. After we left her boot no one else approached us as they may have thought they got us. In part, they did.
Since it was a shared ride (free), we had to wait a bit for all the people. But finally, we made it to the hotel late afternoon. Had some time to check in, take a shower, and find somewhere to have dinner. The hotel had this great Polynesian-style restaurant that performed some characteristic dances, and we enjoyed it.

### The first day

The next morning, we attended the timeshare presentation at the Garza Blanca Hotel. We enjoyed a fantastic breakfast buffet while chatting with a friendly representative. The presentation, which promised discounts on excursions, was lengthy and involved several sales pitches. Eventually, we secured our discounts, didn't enroll in any timeshare but left just past lunchtime.

We took the opportunity to explore a local market, try some local food, and stock up on provisions. Back at the hotel, we spent the afternoon by the pool with our new supplies and tried another restaurant.

Before heading to bed, we planned our itinerary. We were told that Playa Mujeres was the shortest excursion, it starts around noon and back by 7:00 PM, so we decided to put it in the middle to have more time to rest. Xcaret first, as we were told it was great, and Xixen Itza last. Having an extra day before our last day, we decided to rest and enjoy the hotel. Therefore, we scheduled to have a massage that morning and enjoy the beach all afternoon. This was a great idea, as we did too much walking and several activities that take a toll on your body.

### Xcaret

This trip started early in the morning, and we barely had time for a coffee. The bus was on time, and we headed to the park. The trip takes about an hour or so, and there could be a line of buses arriving at the same time. Listen to the guide's instructions as it helps for a smooth adventure. There are several attractions that you have to pay for, apart from the excursion package. We paid for swimming with the Dolphins as Melba hadn't done it before. Unfortunately, due to weather issues, we couldn't swim with the whale sharks or walk with the stingrays. Yeah, so sad, we would have loved it.
<img class="alignleft wp-image-349" src="https://familyventurescafe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/xcaret_cancun-300x200.webp" alt="xcaret cancun mexico" width="400" height="267" />

However, we didn't let that dampen our spirits. We explored the underground rivers, which were enchanting. The crystal-clear waters and the serene ambiance made it feel like we were in another world. After the rivers, we head to the Dolphin swimming area, it is a spectacular experience.

For lunch, we decided to try out the restaurant close to the Dolphin area. It was a buffet. The fresh ceviche was delicious, in addition to several options of traditional Mexican cuisine. After lunch, we wandered through the butterfly pavilion. It was mesmerizing to see so many colorful butterflies fluttering around us. We were fascinated, this place seemed like paradise. We then headed to the aviary, where we saw a stunning array of tropical birds. The vibrant colors and the variety of species were incredible. It was a treat for both the eyes and the ears with all the melodious chirping around us.

One of the most captivating moments of the day was watching the Papantla Flyers. The spectacle was awe-inspiring. We watched in amazement as the performers climbed a tall pole, then, tied by their ankles, descended gracefully while spinning around the pole. The ritual, accompanied by traditional music played from the top of the pole, was both thrilling and deeply moving, showcasing the rich cultural heritage of Mexico.

The last attraction for the night is an amazing show with lots of great music, scenery, and acrobatics. We decided to get the dinner package, where they serve you several typical plates and drinks while watching the magical show about Mexican history. The show was a journey through Mexico’s rich cultural heritage, from the ancient Mayan civilization to modern times. The costumes, the dances, and the storytelling were all breathtaking.

We highly recommend you stay until the last minute of the show; it is spectacular! As we made our way back to the bus, tired but exhilarated, we couldn't stop talking about the day's adventures. Xcaret had truly given us memories to cherish forever.

### Isla Mujeres

It was great to have some time after the exhausting day at Xcaret. This trip didn't include transportation, so we took public transportation. It is safe, and the bus drivers are very friendly with tourists. We headed to the marina, but first, we took the chance to visit the pharmacy right in front of the marina. The medicine there is cheaper for tourists, so we bought several to bring back home—everything from ivermectin to pain relief medication for our grandparents and a cream for chafing burns that worked like magic.
<img class="alignright wp-image-350" src="https://familyventurescafe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/isla_mujeres-300x200.webp" alt="isla mujeres cancun mexico" width="400" height="267" />

While waiting by the beach for the boat to be ready, we enjoyed the pleasant surroundings. This marina was close to a clothing-optional resort, so keep that in mind if you are traveling with kids. In general, this trip was the worst of our excursions. The best part, which was snorkeling, was rushed, and we barely had time to enjoy it. The lunch was awful, with the buffet offering limited options and food that didn't taste great.

Fortunately, we bought some delicious mangoes at the Isla Mujeres beach, another rushed stop. After lunch, we had a brief opportunity to explore the island by golf cart, but again, it was too rushed to truly enjoy. We returned to the beach area by the lunch spot, which wasn't ideal for swimming, so we relaxed on the beach beds until the boat arrived.
Back at the hotel, we unwound in the jacuzzi before heading to bed, ready for the next day's adventures. Despite the disappointments, we tried to make the most of our time and found some moments of joy amidst the rushed and less-than-ideal circumstances.

### Chichen Itza, Xcajum Cenote and Valladolid Tour

Similar to our trip to Xcaret, this tour started early in the morning. The journey to our destination took about two and a half hours, maybe more. Be prepared to either sleep on the bus or listen to the guide. Our guide, a descendant of the Mayans, shared fascinating bits of history during the trip, enriching our understanding and appreciation of the places we were about to visit.

This tour included visits to Chichen Itza, the Xcajum Cenote, and the Colombian-inspired city of Valladolid in Mexico. Unfortunately for us, our itinerary had us visiting the cenote first. Ideally, it’s better to visit the cenote after Chichen Itza so you can refresh in the cold and fresh waters following the intense heat of the archaeological site.

#### Cenote Xcajum
<img class="alignleft wp-image-351" src="https://familyventurescafe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/xcajum-cenote-cancun-300x200.webp" alt="xcajum cancun mexico" width="400" height="267" />

What an interesting place! It seemed like an oasis in the middle of nowhere. Everything was well-organized, and it was evident that the locals managed it without the impersonal feel of big corporations. Speaking the language allowed us to converse with the staff, who shared their experiences and the challenges they faced during the two years without tourism. It was heartening to see how grateful they were for the return of international travelers, as the area relies heavily on tourism. The staff were the kindest hosts you could meet, always ready with a smile and eager to share their culture.
The cenote itself was stunning, with its clear, inviting water that seemed almost magical. Despite the allure, we decided not to swim, as getting wet might have made our visit to Chichen Itza more challenging. Instead, we explored the area, checking out the local souvenirs. We couldn't resist buying a few, including a silver necklace with our initials in Mayan script for Melba, crafted by local jewelers. Supporting these artisans is important, knowing that their craft is a vital source of income.

Lunch was a delightful experience at a cozy local restaurant. Since most excursions visit Chichen Itza first, we had the buffet to ourselves, enjoying a variety of tasty local dishes. The food was excellent, a true taste of the region's culinary offerings.

After a satisfying meal, we felt ready for the main event: Chichen Itza.

#### Chichen Itza

For our visit to Chichen Itza, we were given water bottles with straps to carry easily, as the heat there can be intense. The area doesn’t have many trees, ensuring everyone can enjoy an unobstructed view of the famous Mayan Pyramid. The landscape was unreal and overwhelming, like a shot of reality straight into the veins. Watching documentaries about these monuments doesn’t prepare you for the marvel of seeing them in person.
<img class="alignright wp-image-352" src="https://familyventurescafe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/chichen_cancun-300x200.webp" alt="chichen itza cancun mexico" width="400" height="267" />

Standing before the pyramid, the guide began to explain the history, confirming what we had seen in documentaries. But being there, hearing the stories, and seeing the grandeur of the structure up close was a mix of emotions that words can't fully describe. It's a blend of awe, reverence, and a profound connection to the past.

I highly encourage watching some documentaries beforehand, as this will deepen your appreciation and understanding when you see them in person. The time spent at Chichen Itza felt too short; I could have spent the entire day there, lost in admiration for the greatness of mankind's ancestors.

The intricate carvings, the sheer scale of the pyramid, and the knowledge of the advanced civilization that built it left me in awe. As we walked through the site, each step seemed to echo the whispers of history, and I felt a deep respect for the ingenuity and spirit of the Mayan people.

Leaving Chichen Itza was bittersweet. While our time there was limited, the experience was deeply enriching, leaving an indelible mark on our hearts and minds. The visit was a reminder of the incredible achievements of human history and the enduring legacy of the ancient world.

#### Valladolid
It was time to leave, and our next stop was the magical town of Valladolid. This charming place felt like a piece of Colombia in the heart of Yucatan, reminiscent of the enchanting scenes from "The Encanto" movie. Although it was a quick stop for some sightseeing, we made the most of our time there.
<img class="alignleft wp-image-353" src="https://familyventurescafe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/valladolid_cancun_mexico-300x200.webp" alt="" width="400" height="267" />

The town was a feast for the eyes, with its vibrant colors and unique architecture that made us feel like we had stepped into a storybook. We wandered through the cobblestone streets, admiring the colonial buildings adorned with intricate details. Our tour guide shared fascinating insights about the history and culture of Valladolid, adding depth to our appreciation of this picturesque town.

One of the highlights of our visit was tasting the famous "marquesitas." These crispy, sweet treats were a delight, filled with various delicious fillings like Nutella, cheese, and caramel. While waiting in line for our turn, we noticed two little kids playing with a funny small dog. They had named him Bruno, inspired by the character from "Encanto." Their laughter was infectious, and we couldn't help but smile at their playful antics.

Feeling the warmth of the moment, we decided to gift the kids our water bottles. Their faces lit up with joy and gratitude, and it was a small act of kindness that made our hearts swell. Finally, it was our turn to savor the delectable marquesitas. They were worth the wait, a perfect blend of crispy and creamy that left us wanting more.

As the day came to an end, it was time to head back to the hotel. The two-hour journey back was peaceful and quiet, a stark contrast to the vibrant day we had experienced. Exhausted but content, we fell asleep during the ride, lulled by the gentle hum of the bus. We arrived back at the hotel around 10 PM, our hearts full of memories from our enchanting day.

### Xochimilco

The day before going back, we did not plan anything, other than the couple's massage, as we wanted to rest and enjoy the Hotel before leaving. In the end, we decided to do something anyway. Friends we met on the Isla Mujeres trip told us to consider [Xochimilco](https://www.xcaret.com/en/parks-and-tours/about-xoximilco/). "Why not?" we said, and made reservations for the night. We had lunch by the pool, enjoyed our day by the beach, and visited the Marriott Hotel beside us. The time came to get ready for Xochimilco.
<img class="wp-image-354 alignright" src="https://familyventurescafe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/xochimilco-cancun-300x200.webp" alt="xochimilco cancun mexico" width="400" height="267" />

We boarded the shuttle that would take us to Xochimilco. Upon arrival, the atmosphere was electric. Mariachi music filled the air, and the sight of the brightly colored trajineras, a traditional Mexican boat, was mesmerizing. The landscape at night is magical. You have to walk over some hanging bridges that provide an amazing view of the light spectacle. We boarded our trajinera, joining a group of fellow travelers. By chance, all the travelers were Latinos like us, so we spoke Spanish the whole time. The boat slowly glided through the canals, surrounded by twinkling lights. Our guide, a cheerful local, explained to us stories about Xochimilco's history and culture. He also made sure we all felt welcomed and entertained. 

The trajinera had a cooler in the middle with several refreshing alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks and lots of tequila. The first course was a set of several authentic appetizers from the area, including the chapulines. Is kind of a grasshopper they serve seasoned and fried. After a while, we stopped and there was a band playing classic Mariachi music that we loved. There a courteous and friendly staff removed our plates from the appetizers and brought our entrées, more drinks, and tequila. Each bite was a delight, and the flavors were rich and authentic. The drinks flowed freely, and we toasted to new friends and unforgettable experiences.

Throughout the night, the festive spirit never waned. We sang along with the mariachis, danced on the boat, and even tried our hand at traditional Mexican games. The camaraderie among our group grew stronger as the night progressed, and it felt like we were all part of one big, joyful family.

The highlight of the evening was when our trajinera joined others in a grand flotilla, creating a vibrant and lively floating party. The boats were decorated with colorful lights, and the music from multiple bands blended into a symphony of celebration. We laughed, sang, and danced, lost in the magic of Xochimilco.

As the night drew to a close, we reluctantly made our way back to the hotel, our hearts full and our spirits high. Xochimilco had been more than just an outing; it was an experience that captured the essence of Mexican culture and left us with memories to cherish forever.

The next morning, as we packed our bags and prepared to leave, we couldn't stop talking about the incredible night we had. Xochimilco was the perfect ending to our trip, a vibrant and joyous celebration that would forever hold a special place in our hearts.
