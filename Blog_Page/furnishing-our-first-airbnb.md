The biggest thing on Airbnb is furnishing it and I think we did a wonderful job. You can check [our listing](airbnb.com/h/friendsandpoppies) and let us know how we did it. Lots of imagination was used as we have never designed a space before. We wanted to do it ourselves to try and understand the business before we start thinking on hiring anyone. The instructive videos from [Robuilt](https://www.youtube.com/c/Robuilt), helped us understand the set-up process better. In general, we bought several things here and there. Thrift stores for some decorations. Ikea, off course.
