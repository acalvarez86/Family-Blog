The biggest thing on Airbnb is furnishing it and I think we did a wonderful job. You can check [our listing](airbnb.com/h/friendsandpoppies) and let us know how we did it. Lots of imagination was used as we have never designed a space before. We wanted to do it ourselves to try and understand the business, plus it helped saving money. The instructive videos from [Robuilt](https://www.youtube.com/c/Robuilt), helped us understand the set-up process better. In general, we bought several things here and there. Thrift stores for some decorations. Ikea, off course.

We were trying to buy durabl estuff while saving money, so we went for strong not so pretty stuff and improve decoration. For example for a bedroom we bought metal bases for the bed and only used the frame for decoration, as beds could get destroyed easily.

For the dining set we tried buying something cheap but that looked strong. Easy to paint just in case.

We we didnt have lots of space for living room furniture, but we went ahead with a sofa bed to add extra space for more guests.

We wanted to add an office but since we only had 3 bedrooms we couldnt sacrify one just for an office so we added bunk beds for 2 more guests, saving space to add a desk annd a table for games.

We bought a washer and dryer in facebook market place and a set of appliances in homedepot (this was from when we first set up the hosue for LTR check here [georgetown duplex link] for reference).

evrything else we bought from thrift stores and other different ones to match the style we went for.
