After months without a vacation and a last-minute canceled trip to Tampa that was supposed to be a romantic getaway, we were ready to go anywhere. We considered Denver for a while, then Tennessee, and finally, we settled for Miami.

Miami doesn’t need a presentation. It is well known for its warm weather, awesome cuisine, great beaches, national parks, and Cuban coffee. It has the largest Cuban community in the country. To us, it is a constant reminder of our home country. And how it could have looked like if the Castro Revolution hadn’t happened in 1959.

### Stay

We stayed at the Fashion Boutique Hotel located in South Miami Beach. It is a small and cozy place, with free breakfast and close to the beach, restaurants, a shopping center, and Ocean Drive. Parking was a bit expensive, which seems like a norm in the area. If you are planning to visit the area, read the reviews and budget accordingly.

There is a small cafeteria named Las Olas Café, right around the corner, that serves an awesome Cuban coffee. It is a great place to stop by before a walk to the beach or to energize yourself during the day. We would go more than once a day and Melba would usually get a "cortadito" while Arian would order an espresso.

### Miami Beach

The quality of the beach was our biggest surprise. We have always heard some people and locals saying that the beach is not clean, that the sand is dark, and that it doesn’t compare to the beaches in Cuba. South Pointe Beach is a great place. Crystal clear water and soft sand. Truth be told, it doesn’t have the quality of the beaches in the Northern part of Cuba, but it’s not too far behind.

### Miami Bayside

Of the many attractions of Miami, the Bayside Marketplace is a must-see. It is a waterfront shopping center that sits above Biscayne Bay, in downtown Miami, and that offers a varied entertainment experience with live music, restaurants, bars, and amazing views.

Go and walk the shops, grab a drink at one of many bars, and ride a gondola for breathtaking views from the city at the observation wheel (best at night). Do not leave without taking a sightseeing cruise tour through Biscayne Bay. You will get a local guide, who will narrate the history and gossip around famous Bayside areas like the Port of Miami and Millionaire’s Row. There, you will get a peek at opulent celebrity mansions. Pro tip, go early in the morning for the reservations as they sell out quickly. There are stands all around the place selling the different tours, some of them include a bus tour as well.

### The Keys

Another “must-do” on any trip to Miami is driving for the approximate 159 miles from Miami to Key West. It is a 4-hour ride, a lot of people prefer booking a stay for the weekend. We left our hotel early in the morning and returned the same day. Driving the highway is an amazing experience, furthest from boring. Time flies while you look in amazement at all the spectacular sceneries, driving over a fine line of islands and bridges.

There are several attractions on the Islands. Sites like TripAdvisor and Groupon offer discounts for all kinds of tours and activities. Our advice, prepare your itinerary in advance and book the activities that you see most interesting, always leaving some space for exploring the cute coastal towns.

### Other Interesting Sites

There is so much to do in Miami that you’ll hardly get bored. If you like fashion, don’t forget to check the Design District for great food, well-known brands, luxury shopping, and art.

If you are curious about Cuban culture, go walk the streets of Little Havana. Get a bite at one of the restaurants or specialty food shops that line the streets while the Latin music fills the air. Other great places to visit are the Art Deco Historic District, the Vizcaya Museum and Gardens, and the Everglades National Park. It’s not called the Sunshine State in vain.
