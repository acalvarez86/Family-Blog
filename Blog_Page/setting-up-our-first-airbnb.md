When we were not furnishing or decorating the house, we were setting our first Airbnb up. For this, we used several tools to be able to list it and get our first guests. First let me clarify when we refer to the term Airbnb we refer to the idea of setting up our own bed and breakfast place. We used several hosting platforms not just Airbnb.

Management tools:

Cleaning and maintenance:

The cleaning team is the most important part of your listing. They will make the difference between having lots of headaches with your listing or not. Your cleaning team is the one that will interact with your house the most. They will know every part of it. They should let you know if something is broken if something is missing. However, the most important one is they will make sure the house is spot clean for your guests' enjoyment. Therefore, make sure to looking for good cleaners and to set your expectations beforehand. A close friend referenced our cleaners, and they did not disappoint. We love them and have a great relationship. To be able to keep the good relations, we created a list of all the things inside the house, an inventory. And also a checklist of the things we like them to pay attention the most. Spoiler alert, the kitchen and bathrooms, d'oh. As guest on Airbnb before, we loved when both the kitchen and the bathroom were spot clean. 

For maintenance, you need a good lawn care service, to keep a good curb appeal. And super important the phone number of a great handyman. You never know what can break that may need urgent repair. It is important to guarantee your guest satisfaction.
