## A Wealthy Lifestyle

What would you do if you didn't have to work your 9-5 job? If you had money or investments enough to cover your expenses without having to worry about buying groceries, a mortgage, or a car payment? For us, the answer is simple. We would like to spend more time with our family, doing all the things that inspire us and make us happy.

Don't get me wrong, we know there is no magic beans that will take you to a castle in the clouds full of treasures, and we also know that money is no guarantee of wealth. Like many others before us, after reading Robert Kiyosaki’s book “Rich Dad, Poor Dad”, our mentality switched knowing that wealth is the amount of time you can live the lifestyle of your choice out of your savings, retirement account, and/or your passive income. Very important to note that rich and wealthy are not the same as "the rich have lots of money, but the wealthy doesn’t worry about money.”

Being able to live a healthy lifestyle is also being able to live a wealthy lifestyle, therefore, one key aspect of our journey is to build wealth, and the mobile we have chosen for it is Real Estate.

Why did we choose Real Estate?

Real Estate, while it may be for some people, is not usually a way to get rich quickly. We definitely did not choose it for this reason. However, Real Estate offers several other advantages such as cash flow, tax deductions, appreciation, inflation hedge, the possibility to build equity, portfolio diversification, and leverage of different financing options, among others.

Our main reason for choosing it is the possibility of building passive (or not completely passive) income as the way to achieve our goal of a wealthy lifestyle. We also love the possibility to make a positive impact on other people's life by providing fair and comfortable rental properties and by helping them in their home ownership, while improving neighborhoods and, why not, towns and cities.

If you are thinking about jumping into the Real Estate world, please remember that even though it may be simple for one to build wealth through it, it has some disadvantages like the lack of liquidity, which simply means that converting assets into cash takes longer compared with others like for example stocks. The same way around, converting cash into assets by buying a property can take months between the offer and the closing signature. Like with every other investment, always learn and study which one fits you and your goals the best before jumping in. And remember, whatever you choose, you need to be able to do what it takes: deal with ups and downs, learn from your mistakes, and most important, you need to take action.

Real Estate, for some reason, feels right to us. Learning, reading, and listening to Real Estate podcasts always teach us new things and are very enjoyable moments in our day.

At least for one of us, the love for Real Estate comes from the blood, Arian owes this to his grandfather. By the age of 10, he had already lived in more than seven houses. His grandpa is a house flipper in Cuba, still buying, fixing, and selling even though he is in his 70s. Real Estate laws and conditions in Cuba, like almost everything else, are completely different from the USA, so we are eagerly learning everything we can to, in the near future, be experts in the field.

We bought our first house more than four years ago and proudly noticed how we made a great team during the whole process. Now, we want to continue investing in Real Estate focusing on rental properties.

We recently closed on a duplex, which made us two doors in one transaction. Our Current Real Estate Goal is to have at least 1 more rental propertiy in our portfolio this year jumping to a total of 20 in the next 5 years.
